Jupyter notebooks using PyTorch with Nvidia GPUs 
Dave White - December 2019

##
I took an online course that went through GPU computing
using PyTorch, and finished with an exercise where you
apply a technique called "style transfer" on a trained 
neural network to merge traits of an image onto another.
To just the end result of images processed by the 
NN, view the files in the `Style Transfer Output Files`
folder.

Other folders are notebooks with titles that are self-explanatory:
- Intro_Tensors
- Linear Regression
- Neural Networks
- Perceptrons
- Style Transfer Output Files
- apex -- I don't remember
